            "One simple act of kindness that took place four decades ago marked the beginning of Albukhary Foundationâ€™s journey. When Syed Mokhtar brought home his first salary of RM1,500 as a rice trader in 1974, his mother, Sharifah Rokiah, reminded him that while they lived a humble life, there were others in the community who were poorer. She encouraged him to keep half for the family, and distribute the remaining RM750 to 15 needy families in their community.",
